# Meal-Mate

MealMate is a full-stack web application that brings diners and local eateries closer. It’s designed to solve the common challenges of existing food delivery platforms while enhancing the experience for both users and restaurants.
Imagine scrolling through a list of nearby restaurants, choosing your favorite dishes from a beautifully designed menu, and placing an order with just a few clicks. You can track your meal in real-time, knowing exactly when it will arrive. Meanwhile, the restaurant owner receives your order in their dashboard, updates the preparation status, and ensures you get your food fresh and on time—all without paying huge commissions to third-party platforms.
